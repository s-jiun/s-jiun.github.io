                <p>
                    Hello, I'm Seo Jiun, a student who is interested in developing services that contribute to improving the public interest of society. 
                    In the meantime, I led various application development projects and worked as a development PO and full stack developer. 
                    In addition, the medical aids sharing platform for the disabled and the elderly, "CareShare", was awarded at the 23rd E-Daily Economic Universiade Contest. 
                    Now I’m currently focusing on studies as a Presidential Scientific Scholarship student.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am interested in writing highly readable code. 
                    Of course, I still lack a lot of skills, but I always try to consider the readability of the code as well as the development of  
                    it’s functions while writing the code. I'm trying to spend time to refactor the code regularly with my team members while working on the project.
                    Also, I think it's important to get feedback and develop myself through it. No matter how simple a project or plan is, I always get feedback, 
                    and I feel great pleasure when I find new perspectives that I haven't considered.
                </p>

                        and is not a project focused on web services, but on building CI/CD pipelines. 
                        The web service functions as a simple chatting service that has developed by using Node.Js and Socket.io.
                        The server has utilized GCP and the pipeline has developed by using Docker, Jenkins, and Kubernetes.

                        After taking the lecture and learning the overall contents of deep learning, 
                        I learned about training methods, CNN models, and data augmentation of neural networks. 
                        And we finally completed the course after passing a test that training a model to demonstrate high accuracy.

                        After completing the Pirogramming 15th, I worked as Education Supporting Team at Pirogramming 16th. 
                        My job was to participate in the establishment of the 16th curriculum and create programming tasks, 
                        and to feedback the Python coding test. Also, I taught how to utilize Slack and Jira as project collaboration tools.
                        When I was working on the management team, the task I created was "Design Facebook ERD based on MySQL." 
                        Because there are so many features on Facebook in reality, we organized the task to design <a href="https://www.erdcloud.com/d/SNv5MuHKDwFFsGowc">ERD</a> with only basic features.

                        I have learned the overall contents of web development at Pirogramming, the web development association club. 
                        There are two toy projects that have been done through the club activity.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Mini Game Project (with Python, Crawling)</strong>
                    <p>
                        It consists of four mini games, and I developed a game that guesses the singer's name 
                        by looking at the title of the song. With BeautifulSoup, the program randomly presented the title of the song 
                        and singer's name on the online music chart. We also imported the SequenceMatcher function 
                        so that if the answer is more than 30% similar to the answer you guessed, it will be recognized as correct.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Card Game project (with Django)</strong>
                    <p>
                        You can sign up for the game through Naver Login, Google Login, or General Login, and if you log in, you can bet on other users. 
                        Five cards from random numbers between 1 and 10 are shown and one of them will be selected. If the opponent chooses a card according to the game, 
                        the result of the game can be checked. The person with the larger number of cards selected may win, or the person with the smaller number may win, 
                        which is unknown because the program determines at random. The winner gets as many points as the number of his cards, 
                        and the opponent loses as many points as the number of his cards.

                        At the time of the first trial deployment, we received the domain from 'Freenom' for a free domain, but a problem occured in the process of purchasing and reconnecting the paid domain from Gabia.
                        At first, I had a hard time because I didn't know why I couldn't connect the domain. I thought there was a problem with the NginX server file in the process of analyzing the server. 
                        As a result, we discovered that the problem was that the https certificates of the two domains have been collided in the process of disconnecting the existing domain and connecting the newly purchased domain. 
                        When we deleted the existing certificate and repositioned the new certificate correctly, the domain was connected successfully.

                        If you send a client request, the server sends you a response. At this time, the value returned by each function in the server is different, so the format of the response sent to the client is all different. 
                        But as I developed it, I felt the need of unify their format. In addition, since the response format and response code were not customized, http response of 200,400,500 were basically sent, so there was no way for us to know what the actual problem was.
                        To solve this problem, we created an exception package and created an Enum class called ErrorCode and an ErrorResponse JAVA class. 
                        In the case of ErrorCode, it is a class that contains the response code that we customized, and we have assigned the response code that we had promised for various cases such as no token or invalid or incorrect input values. 
                        And in the case of Error Response, it is a class with a response format set, and all responses had transmitted in the class format.

                        OpenMap is a project conducted while I was taking the "Server System Construction and Practice" course in the spring semester of 2022 at Sungshin Women's University. 
                        Until now, the map services has shown companies near the user, but it was difficult to users to immediately recognize whether the company is opened or closed.

                        OpenMap shows the companies near you, but also the marker colors are different for each company that is open, holiday, and closed. 
                        Other features include registering favorite companies and searching with filters.

                        "OpenMap" is a map service that displays the location of restaurants, rest restaurants, and hospitals near you differently depending on the current business status. 
                        DB queries had become quite complicated because markers were vary depending on the company's type and business status, rather than just displaying markers at the company's location. 
                        As each company has different business days, business hours, and breaks, so the queries had become complicated. 
                        In addition, each time a user changes the area of the map, the company displayed on the map changes, the amount of query has become significant. Also, the speed of service has become slow.
                        For queries that returns the business status of a company, it became simplified by creating View tables and Raw queries in Sequelize migration files.
                        In addition, we adjusted the unit of event occurrence to solve the server load caused by queries which had generated by users changing the map area. 
                        For example, in the past, if a user had generated an event by clicking the mouse, it could be modified to generate an event only when dragging the mouse. 
                        As a result, the query generation had reduced and the service speed had improved more than 50%.
